# tuya-convert_docker
Docker version of [ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert) which allows flashing of Tuya IoT devices to alternative firmwares

For my personal use, not publically supported. It is fairly self-explanatory if you follw the parent repo README https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/blob/master/README.md. For this project, you don't need to follow the 'USING DOCKER' section, as the docker image is already built and available on DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/r/iainbullock/tuya-convert
